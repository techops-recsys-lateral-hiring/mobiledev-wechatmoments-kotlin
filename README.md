- This is a static page.

#### Tech requirements:

- The data JSON will be hosted at localhost:2727
- An example of the response in `Tweet.json`
- Unit tests are appreciated.
- Functional programming is appreciated
- Keep your code clean as much as possible Production and Technical requirements are weighing equally in the final result.
